<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Heart Pump Devices</li><li>Extracorporeal Heart Pump Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart pump market is divided into two main types: implantable heart pump devices and extracorporeal heart pump devices. Implantable heart pumps, such as ventricular assist devices (VADs), are surgically placed inside the body to support weakened hearts, offering long-term assistance for patients with severe heart failure. Extracorporeal heart pumps, on the other hand, are external devices that temporarily aid cardiac function, commonly used during surgical procedures or in acute heart failure scenarios, providing vital support until recovery or further treatment.</p></p>
