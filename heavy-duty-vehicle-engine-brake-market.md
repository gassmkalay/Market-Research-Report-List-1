<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy-duty Vehicle Engine Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compression Release Brake</li><li>Exhaust Brake</li><li>Retarder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heavy-duty vehicle engine brake market is dominated by three main types: compression release brakes, exhaust brakes, and retarders. Compression release brakes utilize engine compression to slow down vehicles, making them effective for mountainous terrains. Exhaust brakes reduce engine speed by restricting exhaust flow, allowing for smoother deceleration. Retarders, often hydraulic or electric, provide additional braking force without wear on traditional brakes, improving safety and vehicle control. Together, these technologies enhance braking efficiency and performance in heavy-duty applications.</p></p>
